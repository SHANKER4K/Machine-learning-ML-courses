    "### 🎯 What is Research?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Research is a **systematic and rigorous process** to:\n",
    "- Explore phenomena\n",
    "- Solve problems\n",
    "- Question or challenge previous results\n",
    "- Experiment with new solutions\n",
    "- Apply practices\n",

    "### 🔬 The Scientific Method (Claude Bernard)\n",
    "\n",
    "Research follows 3 main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Observation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it is:** Carefully watching and recording what happens\n",
    "- **Types:**\n",
    "  - Occasional (by chance)\n",
    "  - Systematic (planned and organized)\n",
    "  - Naturalistic (in real environment)\n",
    "  - Clinical (controlled settings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ Bad: \"I think students are stressed\"\n",
    "- ✅ Good: \"I observed that 15 out of 20 students reported stress during exams over 3 months\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it is:** A clear statement about what you expect to find\n",
    "- **Not a guess** - it's an informed prediction based on observation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ Bad: \"Maybe studying helps?\"\n",
    "- ✅ Good: \"Students who study 2+ hours daily will score 15% higher than those who study less than 1 hour\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Experimentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it is:** Testing your hypothesis through controlled actions\n",
    "- **Key point:** \"Experimentation is just a provoked observation\" - Claude Bernard\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare test scores of two groups: one studies 2 hours/day, another studies 30 min/day\n"

    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Systematic Observation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Watch carefully and with purpose\n",
    "- Always keep your research question in mind\n",
    "- Don't get distracted by irrelevant details\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Questioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always ask \"why?\" and \"how?\"\n",
    "- Your research question guides everything\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on specific characteristics\n",
    "- Define your terms clearly\n",
    "- Remove unnecessary details\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Studying \"happiness\" → Define it as \"life satisfaction score from 1-10\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Following a Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use precise procedures\n",
    "- Research value = quality of method used\n",
    "- Be systematic, not random\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Open-mindedness**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accept all results, even unexpected ones\n",
    "- Don't force data to fit your beliefs\n",
    "- Be ready to admit when you're wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You hypothesize coffee improves memory\n",
    "- Results show it doesn't\n",
    "- ✅ Good: \"My hypothesis was not supported\"\n",
    "- ❌ Bad: Ignoring data or manipulating it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Objectivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separate personal beliefs from findings\n",
    "- State your biases upfront\n",
    "- Test hypotheses fairly\n",
    "\n",

    "**Topic:** Artificial Intelligence in Education\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **BAD Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In this thesis, I will talk about AI in education. AI is important. Education is important too. Many people use AI. I will study this topic. My thesis has five chapters.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:** Too vague, no problem statement, no research question, boring\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **GOOD Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Artificial intelligence is transforming industries worldwide, with the global AI market projected to reach $500 billion by 2024 (Smith, 2023). Yet in education, a sector serving over 1.5 billion students globally, AI adoption remains limited—only 23% of educational institutions have implemented AI-based tools (Brown et al., 2023). This gap is concerning, as preliminary studies suggest AI could personalize learning and improve student outcomes by up to 30% (Lee, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, critical questions remain unanswered: What barriers prevent educational institutions from adopting AI? How do teachers perceive AI integration? And most importantly, does AI-based personalized learning actually improve student performance in real classroom settings?\n",
    "\n",
    "This research investigates these questions through a mixed-methods study of 50 schools implementing AI learning platforms. Specifically, we ask: **What factors influence successful AI adoption in schools, and what measurable impact does AI-personalized learning have on student achievement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, this thesis is organized in four chapters. Chapter 1 reviews existing literature on AI in education and technology adoption theories. Chapter 2 presents our research methodology, combining surveys of 200 teachers, interviews with 20 administrators, and analysis of student performance data from 1,000 students. Chapter 3 presents findings on adoption barriers and learning outcomes. Finally, Chapter 4 discusses implications for educational policy and future research directions.\"\n",

    "**Action:** \"I took a systematic approach. First, I analyzed the slow queries using database profiling tools and identified the problem: missing indexes on frequently queried columns. Second, I restructured some N+1 queries into efficient joins. Third, I implemented query caching for repeated searches. I also wrote test scripts to measure improvements at each step.\"\n",
